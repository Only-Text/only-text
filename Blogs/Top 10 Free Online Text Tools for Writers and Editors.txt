“Top 10 Free Online Text Tools for Writers and Editors” – A roundup post that could list useful text manipulation tools (mention Only Text as #1 of course). Others could be things like a word counter, grammar checker, etc. While this lists other tools, it’s good for SEO because list articles attract clicks and you’d be positioning Only Text in a context of helpful resources. (As an SEO play, listing known tools might also bring their searchers to your site, and since your tool is featured prominently, you could convert them into users of Only Text).
