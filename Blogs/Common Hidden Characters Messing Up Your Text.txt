“Common Hidden Characters Messing Up Your Text” – Discuss invisible or seldom-seen special characters (non-breaking spaces, zero-width spaces, smart quotes, etc.) that often copy-paste into text from Word or PDFs. Explain how these can cause issues (like search mismatches or formatting problems) and suggest using Only Text to strip out all those “gremlins”. This targets long-tail searches like “remove invisible characters from text”.
